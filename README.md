## Petstgram
Is a social media app thats design to post pet pictures like Instagram.

## Motivation
Motivation for development was to help people emotionally and business-like to  decrease stress by viewing photos of cute animals. And to help individuals and shelters to increase visibility and value.
Social Media can be overwhelming and sometimes you just need to look at some cute animal without everything else happening in the world.According to a study by the University of Leeds, watching and looking at cute animals on social media helps reduce anxiety and improves our mental and physical health.The study found that after watching animal videos and looking at pictures the participants heart rate was reduced by 6.6% and blood pressure decreased by an average of 14.9%
In a study released by ASPCA,
“Among the many positive impacts of social media use, those surveyed indicated it increased general awareness about their organization (86 percent), increased animal adoptions overall (66 percent) and increased adoptions of harder to place animals, like senior pets and those with medical issues (55 percent).”
